# Matts Hangman Game Project 

The project is to create a game of Hangman from scratch using coding practices I have learned throughout the AI Core lessons. The aim of the project is to create code in which the code will generate a random word, user will then input a "guess" which will be a single letter. Using functions, the code will then check to see if the input is indeed a single letter, and then will also check whether that letter is contained within the randomly generated word.

Milestone 1: (Not documented) - Use the preset tools to create the envorinment for this game
Milestone 2: This document creates the variables for the game
Milestone 3: This document creates loops which check if the guessed letter is within the random word, and provides notes for the player
Milestone 4: This document creates the classes used within the game

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
